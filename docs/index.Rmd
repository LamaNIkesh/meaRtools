# Introduction

This page describes some of the documentation and resources for the
[meaRtools project](http://github.com/igm-team/meaRtools).  Here are
some key links for the project.

* [Project repository on github](http://github.com/igm-team/meaRtools)
* [biorxiv manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/12/242065)
* [STTC vignette](./sttc.html)
* [data_input vignette](./data_input.html)
* [General usage vignette](./meaRtoolsGeneralUsage.html)
* [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/index.html)
    
	
Please note that although the vignettes are also available on CRAN,
they do not contain the figures, whereas the above links have been
precompiled to include the figures within the HTML.  (This is simply
because including the figures on CRAN makes the repository too large.)
  
<!-- The vignettes are built using the "self-contained" branch of the repo. -->
